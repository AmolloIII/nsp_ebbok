The National Spatial Plan (NSP) aims at providing a spatial framework for the country to achieve economic efficiency, global competitiveness, balanced regional development, livable and functional human settlements and environmental sustainability for high quality of life.

It is geared towards facilitating realization of the Constitutional promises as enshrined in the Bill of Rights including the right to a clean and healthy environment. It lays a foundation for the promotion of the land policy principles of equity, efficiency, productivity and sustainable use of the land resource.

The Sessional Paper No. 3 of 2009 on the National Land Policy recognizes land use planning as essential for the efficient and sustainable utilization and management of land and land-based resources. The Policy advocates for the preparation of a land use plan at the national level and actualization of spatial frameworks for orderly management of human activities to ensure that such activities are carried out while taking into account aspects of economy, safety, aesthetics, harmony and environmental sustainability principles which the National Spatial Plan upholds.

The Plan covers the entire country encompassing all the forty seven (47) counties and includes the Exclusive Economic Zone. It recognizes that Kenya is greatly endowed with massive and diverse resources distributed over the national space that require to be managed in a concerted manner. In spite of the rich resource endowment, the country faces challenges related to skewed development, declining agricultural production, under-utilization of resources, rapid and unplanned urbanization, inefficient transport systems and environmental degradation. The NSP has outlined policies and strategies aimed at optimizing the countryâ€™s potentials while mitigating the challenges.

The preparation of the NSP commenced with the development of a concept paper which provided the road map for the formulation of the Plan. Benchmarking through desktop research was undertaken to draw lessons from best global practices on national planning. A team from the Malaysian Government provided useful insights into the process having successfully prepared and implemented a national plan for Malaysia. Locally, experts drawn from various public and private sectors were brought on board to provide technical input and to contribute their expertise and experiences. The Plan benefited from inputs by the counties with six regional workshops held, each bringing together clusters of counties.

The Plan provides comprehensive strategies and policy guidelines to address issues of balanced development, modernizing agriculture, appropriate infrastructure development, diversifying tourism, promoting industrialization, integrating transportation, protecting and conserving the environment as well as creating sustainable human settlements. Further, the Plan offers a coordinating framework for various sectors involved in spatial planning and implementation. The Plan also provides physical planning policies to guide the preparation of lower level plans such as Regional Plans, County Spatial Plans, Local Physical Development Plans and Urban Plans.

To actualize the NSP, a comprehensive implementation strategy has been proposed that embraces a multiplicity of actors including National Government Ministries, Departments and Agencies, County Governments and the National Land Commission. The strategy proposes the establishment of the following institutions as key in the implementation of the Plan: The National Physical Planning Council, the National Technical Committee and the County Physical Planning Committee.

It is my expectation that the National Spatial Plan will receive the requisite budgetary support from both the national and county governments necessary for its implementation. This will facilitate socio-economic transformation necessary for attainment of the Kenya Vision 2030 aspiration of making the county globally competitive.
