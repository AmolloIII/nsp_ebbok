The Ministry of Lands and Physical Planning is charged with the responsibility of formulating general principles of land planning. In this respect, the Department of Physical Planning of the Ministry has prepared the National Spatial Plan (NSP) which sets out policies and strategies to guide the spatial development of the country. The Plan is an important milestone not only for the Ministry but also for the country having been identified as a flagship project under the Kenya Vision 2030 as one of the foundations for the country’s socio economic transformation.

The Plan culminates in a National Spatial Structure that provides a spatial illustration of all national projects and proposes policies and measures for socio-economic development. In addition, it provides an implementation framework to guide the realization of the proposals therein. The preparation of the Plan comes at a time when the country is involved in many initiatives aimed at transforming the country into a globally competitive and prosperous nation.

The National Spatial Plan details out the national vision that will guide the long term spatial development of the country for a period of 30 years. It covers the entire territory of Kenya and defines the general trend and direction of spatial development for the country. It aims at achieving an organized, integrated, sustainable and balanced development of the country by providing a framework for better national organization and linkages between different activities within the national space.

Further, the Plan supports the implementation of strategic national projects specifically the flagship projects spelt out under Kenya Vision 2030 by indicating their spatial locations and providing a framework for absorbing the spatial impacts of these projects. It provides a coordinating framework for sectoral planning which has been lacking in the country and aims to address the disconnect that has existed for a long time between physical and economic planning. This is expected to result in more prudent use of the country’s scarce resources by providing a platform for prioritization of programmes and projects within the implementation mechanism.

Land as we all know is inelastic yet it has many competing and ever expanding demands. Land in Kenya has not been optimally utilized and its use has in some instances resulted into conflicts. The National Spatial Plan provides a framework for the efficient, productive and sustainable use of land as advocated for in both the Constitution and the National Land Policy. Further, it provides strategies and policies to facilitate sustainable exploitation of the huge potentials the country possesses for agriculture, tourism, energy, water, fishing and forestry. It is expected to reduce regional inequalities that have existed by ensuring that these regions are no longer perceived as low potential but as differently endowed.

The Plan is essential at this point when devolution is taking shape as it will provide a guide for development planning by the counties as they discharge their responsibility of preparing county and local plans. The National Spatial Plan provides physical planning policies which the plans at county level are expected to mainstream and propagate. These policies include protection of rich agricultural land, conservation of environmentally sensitive areas, urban containment and promotion of industrial development, among others.

Since independence, the country has grappled with a myriad of problems and challenges such as rapid and unregulated urbanization, environmental degradation of the country’s diverse ecosystems, unbalanced development due to the implementation of policies in favor of the perceived high potential areas, poor economic performance in the areas of agriculture, tourism and industry due to sub-optimal use of land and underutilization of the rich natural resource endowment. Other challenges include inadequate and poor quality transport and infrastructure and an inadequate national policy framework for guiding spatial planning. The National Spatial Plan provides a framework for dealing with these challenges through the formulation of planning and development strategies, policies and measures under which projects and other priority programmes will be implemented for the next 30 years.

The approach adopted during the preparation of the Plan was highly participatory, collaborative and consultative. The process brought on board participants from diverse backgrounds including National Government ministries, departments, agencies, county governments, professionals, the academia, civil society, non-state actors among others. This is not only in conformity with the Constitutional requirements on public participation in policy making but it is hoped that this will provide the requisite basis for the implementation of the Plan.

It is imperative that as a nation, we must prioritize the implementation of this policy document so as to promote equity and competitiveness within and across the 47 counties. For the country to be globally competitive, we need to balance development across the country and promote optimal utilization of land and land based resources as well as to cultivate an integrated approach to development in order to address the intertwined problems of regional imbalances, skewed development and unsustainable human settlements. Let us all individually and collectively commit ourselves to the realization of the development policies and strategies contained herein and continue working together in order to build a competitive, equitable and prosperous Nation.
