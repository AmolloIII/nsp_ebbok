The preparation of the first National Spatial Plan (NSP) has been a success attributed to the concerted efforts of various actors; both in government and in the private sector. I take this opportunity to gratefully acknowledge the roles and contributions of everyone individually and collectively towards the completion of this important national initiative.

I am indebted to the management and staff of the Ministry of Lands and Physical Planning for their effort and support during the entire period of Plan preparation.

My deepest gratitude to the experts from the various government sectors: Tourism, Housing, Agriculture, Energy, Environment, Industry and Trade who contributed their expertise and time during the Plan formulation process.

My appreciation goes out to the experts from the institutions of higher learning specifically from Maseno University, Moi University, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology and the University of Nairobi for their useful insights into the National Plan.

I wish to acknowledge the County Governments who were instrumental in providing county specific information regarding the resource potentials, levels of utilization and the challenges being experienced within the counties.

Special recognition to the National Social and Economic Council (NESC), Kenya Institute of Public Policy and Research (KIPPRA), Kenya Forest Services (KFS), Kenya Wildlife Services (KWS), Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO), Kenya National Highways Authority (KENHA), Kenya Investment Authority (KenInvest), National Environment Management Authority (NEMA), Geothermal Development Company (GDC), National Irrigation Board (NIB), Kenya Railways, World Wide Fund (WWF) and Africa Wildlife Foundation (AWF) for their immense contribution towards the achievement of the Plan.
