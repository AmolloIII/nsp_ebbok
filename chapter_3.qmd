# Chapter 2: DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES

## Overview

The National Spatial Plan (NSP) outlines strategies to guide Kenya's spatial growth and development in line with Kenya Vision 2030. These strategies aim to:

1.  Optimize land and natural resource use

2.  Promote livable and functional human settlements

3.  Achieve balanced regional development

4.  Modernize agriculture and uplift rural livelihoods

5.  Integrate national transportation and infrastructure systems

6.  Conserve environmental assets for sustainability

The NSP emphasizes global competitiveness, improved land access for investment, and the provision of high-quality infrastructure. An integrated transport system is central to boosting mobility and productivity. Recognizing the challenges of spontaneous urbanization, the plan advocates for selective concentration of urban growth based on role specialization to enhance urban livability.

Since 67% of Kenyans live in rural areas and depend on agriculture, a strategy focused on rural transformation through modern agricultural practices and improved rural incomes is prioritized.

## Key Strategic Areas

### 1. Managing Global Competitiveness

In a rapidly integrating world, globalization has reshaped traditional national operations through technology, trade, investment, and political dynamics. Kenya, being part of this global arena, must anticipate global influences and strategically leverage opportunities while mitigating threats.

To boost competitiveness and achieve Vision 2030 targets, Kenya must:

-   Embrace industrialization and move towards a middle-income economy

-   Attract investments in emerging sectors such as ICT, knowledge economy, niche tourism, and manufacturing

-   Develop strategic projects like:

    -   LAPSSET corridor
    -   Resort cities (e.g., Lamu, Turkana, Isiolo)
    -   International airport upgrades (e.g., JKIA, Moi International)
    -   Establish International Financial Centres

### 2. Optimal Use of Land and Resources

Strategic planning will ensure sustainable and equitable use of Kenya’s rich natural resources. Emphasis is placed on land suitability, resource mapping, and minimizing conflicts between competing land uses.

### 4. Urbanization

Urban growth is to be guided through spatial planning, infrastructure development, and role-based specialization of urban areas to reduce congestion and support livable environments.

### 5. Rural Development

The NSP seeks to modernize agriculture, diversify rural economies, and improve rural infrastructure and services, thus raising incomes and reducing rural-urban migration.

### 6. Environmental Conservation

The Plan promotes Environmental Sensitivity Analysis (ESA) to guide conservation efforts. Kenya’s diverse environmental assets will be protected and sustainably used, ensuring they contribute to development without being degraded.

## Emerging Global Trends

Kenya must adapt to key global trends to remain competitive in a globalized, rapidly evolving economy. The NSP outlines six emerging trends and recommends strategic actions for Kenya to harness their benefits.

1.  **Open Markets for Goods and Services**

The globalization of markets rewards nations that produce high-quality, low-cost goods. Kenya faces challenges due to high production costs, inefficient infrastructure, and outdated technology. To compete globally, Kenya must:

-   Promote energy diversification (e.g., solar, wind, geothermal)

-   Lower production costs and improve quality

-   Embrace economic reforms such as deregulation and trade liberalization

2.  **Open Movement of Capital**

To attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), Kenya must offer high returns and stable conditions. Constraints like high energy costs and bureaucracy hinder investment. Strategic urban centers like Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru, and Eldoret should be targeted as investment hubs.

2.  **Economic Integration and Specialization**

Greater regional integration (e.g., in EAC and COMESA) and sectoral specialization can reduce capital costs and boost growth. Kenya should:

-   Strengthen trade and planning cooperation within regional blocs

-   Leverage comparative advantages in horticulture, tourism, and services

4.  **FDI Attraction Through Steady Growth**

FDIs are drawn to stable, growing economies. Kenya’s fluctuating growth, political risks, and weak business environment deter investors. The country must:

-   Stabilize its economy

-   Promote diversification (e.g., expand manufacturing and services)

-   Optimize underutilized regions

5.  **Knowledge, Technology, and Innovation Economies**

The global shift to knowledge-based economies demands skilled human capital, strong ICT infrastructure, and innovation ecosystems. Kenya should:

-   Develop ICT policies and research institutions

-   Attract and retain knowledge workers

-   Encourage universities and tech hubs in emerging towns

6.  **Blue Economy Potential**

Kenya’s marine and aquatic resources remain under exploited. The country has an Exclusive Economic Zone of 142,400 km² and an extended continental shelf of over 103,000 km². The Blue Economy (fishing, shipping, energy, marine mining) offers untapped potential. Constraints include low awareness, poor technology, and funding. The NSP calls for:

-   Awareness creation

-   Capacity building

-   Investment in blue economy infrastructure

## Kenya’s Comparative Advantages

Kenya holds unique strategic advantages that can be leveraged to tap into global opportunities:

a)  Strategic Geographic Location Kenya is a gateway to Africa, with Nairobi and Mombasa providing connectivity to 80+ countries. Its equatorial position ensures year-round moderate climate and offers satellite launch potential.

b)  Rich Natural Resources Kenya is endowed with solar, wind, geothermal, and mineral resources (e.g., oil, coal, rare earths). These support industrialization, tourism, fishing, and energy generation.

c)  Developed Transportation Network

The country has a robust transport infrastructure including:

-   International highways and railways (e.g., Northern Corridor)

-   Port of Mombasa

-   International airports (e.g., JKIA)

d)  International-Grade Cities Nairobi:

-   A regional financial and diplomatic hub hosting UN agencies and multinationals. Strong infrastructure supports its competitiveness.

-   Mombasa: Kenya’s second-largest city and a key seaport serving East and Central Africa. Offers enormous trade and logistics potential.

### Constraints to Kenya’s Economic Competitiveness and Efficiency

Kenya's economy is largely dependent on subsistence agriculture, with relatively weak service and manufacturing sectors, which limits its global competitiveness. The following are key constraints identified:

**1. Inefficient Urban and National Transport Systems**

-   Urban transport, especially in Nairobi, suffers from traffic congestion, lack of modal integration, and inadequate public transport.

-   Poor road maintenance, low rail coverage, and inefficient port and air operations contribute to national transport inefficiencies.

-   Commuting from JKIA to Nairobi CBD can take up to 3 hours for 20 km due to congestion and poor planning.

2.  **Unreliable and Expensive Energy Supply**

-   Electricity access is low (15%) and costly—four times that of South Africa, three times that of China.

-   Power is often unreliable due to outages and fluctuations.

-   Heavy reliance on oil from the Middle East threatens supply security.

-   High energy costs are prompting some companies to relocate to more energy-efficient countries, undermining Kenya’s investment appeal.

3.  **Unattractive Business Climate**

-   Kenya ranks 129 out of 198 in the World Bank’s 2014 Ease of Doing Business index, behind regional peers like Ethiopia and Zambia.

-   Major challenges include:

    -   Starting a business (rank 134)
    -   Getting electricity (166)
    -   Registering property (163)
    -   Paying taxes (166)
    -   Trading across borders (156)
    -   Enforcing contracts (151)
    -   Resolving insolvency (123)

The country performs well in:

-   Dealing with construction permits (rank 47)

-   Getting credit (rank 13)

These challenges inhibit Kenya’s economic efficiency and global competitiveness, and unless addressed through reforms in infrastructure, energy, and regulation, the country will struggle to achieve its Vision 2030 goals.

## Optimizing the Use of Land and Natural Resources

The Constitution of Kenya (Article 60 and 260) and the National Land Policy (Sessional Paper No. 3 of 2009) emphasize the efficient, productive, and sustainable use of land and natural resources. This aligns with Vision 2030’s goal of making Kenya globally competitive by organizing and managing land more effectively.

To optimize land use, the strategy promotes a rational allocation of land based on its capabilities and potential. It integrates environmental conservation with national development needs like agriculture, infrastructure, tourism, and industry. A multi-sectoral approach is encouraged to enhance land productivity, especially in agriculture, livestock, and natural resource exploitation.

A national land assessment considered factors such as land capability, agricultural potential, natural resources, tourism, environmental sensitivity, and human settlement impact. The analysis reveals that all parts of Kenya—including arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs), transition zones, and prime agricultural regions—have potential for productive use. Even environmentally sensitive and physically challenging areas can support economic activities like tourism, filmmaking, and research.

Ultimately, the NSP aims to put the entire Kenyan territory into productive economic use, with strategic planning that considers population growth, agro-ecological and agro-climatic zones, existing land use, and the need for conservation.

### Agricultural Capability Assessment

Kenya's agricultural potential is shaped by its diverse agro-climatic and ecological zones, as well as natural resources like rivers, lakes, and fertile soils. Assessment parameters include agro-zones, land use, water availability, soil type, and slope. Key agricultural zones include:

-   Grain basket areas for maize and wheat.

-   Transition areas for both livestock and crops.

-   Irrigation zones for high-value crops.

-   ASALs as livestock "meat baskets."

-   Aquaculture and fishing zones for fish farming and marine industries.

Key challenges include:

-   Land competition from human settlement, especially in high-potential zones.

-   Water scarcity in ASALs and transition zones.

-   Overgrazing and underutilization of rangelands.

-   Poor infrastructure and limited adoption of modern technology.
