# Chapter 2: THE PLANNING CONTEXT

## Overview

This chapter outlines the key perspectives and trends that informed the National Spatial Plan's preparation. These include: Kenya's **geographical context** (location, physical structure, diversity), **population growth and dynamics** (projected to reach 77.5 million by 2030 and 111 million by 2045), **economic growth trends and prospects** (including barriers to achieving the targeted 10% GDP growth), the critical role of **transport and infrastructure** as development enablers, **human settlement patterns** impacting urban and rural land use, and existing **land use categories** (primarily agriculture, built-up areas, and conservation).

## Strategic Geographical Position and Assets

Kenya occupies a strategically advantageous location on Africa's eastern coast, straddling the Equator. It shares borders with Uganda, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Somalia. Its position provides global connectivity via air and sea transport. The country's total territory spans 582,646 km², including significant inland water bodies like Lake Victoria (3,755 km²) and Rift Valley lakes (Nakuru, Naivasha, Baringo, Turkana, Bogoria). Crucially, Kenya boasts a 1,420 km Indian Ocean coastline (45.7% in Lamu County, featuring islands) and extensive maritime territory, including a 142,400 km² Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

## Regional Hub Status

Kenya's geography underpins its role as a major regional hub. The Port of Mombasa serves not only Kenya but also acts as a vital gateway for landlocked neighbors including Northern Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. This strategic location, combined with its extensive coastline and maritime resources, solidifies Kenya's position as an international transportation, trade, business, and financial center within the region.

## Physiography

### Topography

Kenya’s diverse topography is characterized by plains, plateaus, hills, and mountains (see Map 2.3). One of the most spectacular features is the Great Rift Valley system that extends from the Middle East to Mozambique and bisects the country into the west and east of Rift Valley. It features the snowcapped Mt. Kenya, Mt. Elgon, Mau Escarpment, Cherangani Hills and Aberdare ranges and Lakes such as Turkana, Magadi, Naivasha, Nakuru, Baringo, Elementaita, Bogoria). To the west of the Rift Valley lies Lake Victoria.

The northern and south eastern parts of the country are generally plains punctuated with numerous mountains and hills. Chalbi is the only true desert in Kenya and is found to the east of Lake Turkana. The coastal area contains coral reefs, mangroves and white sandy beaches of the Indian Ocean.

```

### Soils and Geology

Kenya features diverse soil types crucial for land use planning: Loamy soils dominate Western Kenya/Rift Valley; Alluvial soils occur in river valleys; fertile Volcanic (red earth) soils support tea/coffee in highlands; moisture-retentive Black Cotton (clay) soils are found in Mwea/Athi Plains; and nutrient-poor Sandy soils cover arid northern, coastal, and river valley areas. Geologically, Kenya comprises five major formations: Archean rocks (mineral-rich Western Craton with gold/copper), Proterozoic Mozambique Belt (central gemstones/industrial minerals), sedimentary basins (coastal limestone/titanium sands, inland construction materials), Rift Valley volcanics (soda ash, diatomite, gemstones), and Quaternary sediments.

### Vegetation and Climate

Kenya's forests – including volcanic mountains, western plateaus, coastal stands, and riverine corridors – are biodiverse but fragmented due to agricultural pressure. Climate varies regionally: Western Kenya has year-round rain (peaking April) and warm temperatures (14-36°C); Rift Valley/Central Highlands experience temperate conditions (10-28°C) with bimodal "long" (Mar-Jun) and "short" (Oct-Nov) rains; Arid/Semi-Arid Lands endure extreme diurnal temperature shifts (20-40°C) and sparse rainfall (250-500mm); Coastal zones maintain humid, monsoon-driven weather (22-30°C) with peak rains in May.

### Drainage Systems

Kenya's hydrology is structured through international drainage basins (Nile, Turkana, Juba-Shibeli, Natron) and five major domestic catchments: Lake Victoria Basin (world's 2nd largest freshwater lake), Lake Turkana Basin (world's largest desert lake), Ewaso Ng’iro North, Ewaso Ng’iro South, and Tana River Basin. These watersheds govern water resource distribution and management across the country.

## Rich and Diverse Natural Resource Endowment

Kenya is endowed with abundant natural resources that support various economic activities:

**Minerals** Kenya has a wide range of mineral resources categorized into energy, metallic, and non-metallic minerals. Key minerals include soda ash, fluorspar, gold, iron ore, titanium, and coal. However, full exploitation is limited due to land tenure issues, lack of geological data, and infrastructural challenges. Some minerals are found in protected areas like parks and forests, complicating access.

**Ecosystems and Biodiversity** Kenya hosts diverse ecosystems—from mountains to coastlines—home to rich biodiversity and over 40 cultural communities. This supports livelihoods in agriculture, pastoralism, tourism, fishing, and renewable energy. Spatial planning must account for these environmental and cultural dynamics.

**Wildlife** Wildlife is central to Kenya’s tourism sector, with 23 national parks, 28 reserves, and multiple marine parks/reserves. However, poaching, habitat loss, and human-wildlife conflict pose major threats. Notably, over 80% of wildlife lives outside protected areas.

**Energy Resources** Energy is vital to Vision 2030. Kenya has vast untapped potential in:

***Hydropower:*** 2,987 MW across five major river basins.

***Geothermal:*** 7,000–10,000 MW in the Rift Valley.

***Wind:*** Strong winds in Marsabit, Turkana, and Coast.

***Solar:*** High solar radiation due to equatorial location.

***Coal and Oil:*** Deposits in Mui Basin (Kitui) and Turkana Basin.

The Lake Turkana Wind Power Project is a flagship initiative aiming to supply 310 MW, about 20% of national demand.

## Population and Demographic Trends

Population analysis is essential for planning. Understanding the structure and dynamics of the population enables the development of programs that meet current and future socio-economic needs.

### Population Size and Growth

Kenya’s population grew from 10.9 million (1969) to 38.6 million (2009) and was projected to reach 48.8 million by 2016.

The annual growth rate remained at 3.4% from 1969-89 but declined to 2.9% (1989–1999), with a notable exception in North Eastern Kenya, where the growth rate doubled between 1999 and 2009.

Projected population is estimated to be 55.8 million people by 2020

These trends are crucial for achieving the Kenya Vision 2030 goal of ensuring a high quality of life for all citizens.

![Growth of Population over the Years](images/clipboard-1190662347.png)

### Population Distribution

Distribution is uneven: Densely populated areas are in Central and Western Kenya.

-   Most populated counties: Nairobi, Kakamega, Kiambu

-   Least populated: Lamu, Isiolo, Samburu

Age distribution shows a youthful population:

-   40% of Kenyans are under 15 years

-   Demand for youth-oriented services and infrastructure is high

Planning implications: Need for increased investment in services for young (0–24 years) and working-age (25–59 years) groups.

![Kenya’s Population Pyramid](images/clipboard-2299946950.png)

## Population Density

Average national density (2009): 66 persons/km², expected to have increased.

-   High-density counties: Nairobi (4515), Mombasa (4292), Vihiga (1045), Kisii (675)

-   Low-density counties: Isiolo (6), Tana River (6), Marsabit (4)

Consequences of high population density:

-   Pressure on natural resources (water, forests)

-   Land fragmentation and degradation

-   Strain on infrastructure

-   High urbanization rates in fertile zones like Nairobi and Central Kenya

### Urban Population Demographic Trends

The Kenya urban population in 2009 stood at 31.3% and it has been steadily rising as reflected by a growth rate of 4.4%. Kenya Vision 2030 estimates that over 50% of the total population will be living in urban areas by the year 2030. The urban areas should therefore be well planned and provided with the requisite infrastructure and services to take care of the rising urban population. Figure 2.3 illustrates the urban population trends in Kenya as from the year 1960.

## Economic Performance and Prospects

Kenya Vision 2030 aims for a sustained annual GDP growth rate of 10%, requiring improved efficiency and coordinated socio-economic and physical planning. The National Spatial Plan (NSP) is positioned to guide this growth by supporting informed investment planning, balanced regional development, and improved urban and rural environments.

**Global and Regional Trends** Global economy grew by 3.3% in 2013–2014, driven by low oil prices and inflation.Sub-Saharan Africa growth slowed from 5.1% in 2014 to 3.8% in 2015 due to falling commodity prices.Countries like China and India experienced rapid growth through liberalization, reform, and foreign investment—models Kenya could learn from.

**Kenya’s Position** Within the East African Community (EAC), Kenya leads in investment and trade due to its diversified economy, skilled labor force, and political stability. Domestic GDP grew by 5.6% in 2015, supported by sectors like agriculture, construction, finance, and real estate. Some sectors, like hospitality and retail, showed slower or negative growth.

**Key Economic Drivers** Major contributors to Kenya’s economy include agriculture, construction, trade, transport, manufacturing, and finance.

**Constraints** Economic growth has been unstable and heavily reliant on agriculture, which is weather-dependent.

Other constraints include limited value addition, underexploited resources (e.g. tourism, mining), poor governance, and weak marketing systems. Kenya’s trade deficit is due to exporting low-value raw products and importing high-value goods.

**NSP Interventions** Proposes agricultural transformation via irrigation, fertilizer plants, and value-addition facilities in every county.

Advocates for urban improvements and an integrated transport system to boost investment.

Supports planning for value addition to reduce import-export imbalance.

**Opportunities** FDI inflows have risen since 2006 due to ICT growth and active promotion.

The NSP will promote Special Economic Zones (SEZs), Export Processing Zones (EPZs), and investment parks to attract more FDI and ground Vision 2030 proposals.

## Transport and Infrastructure

### Overview

Transportation is a critical driver of economic growth in Kenya, enhancing regional connectivity and facilitating the efficient movement of goods and people. The national transport system includes road, rail, air, water, and pipeline transport, with road transport being the most widely used.

Roads: Total length of 160,886 km, with only 11,189 km paved and the rest unpaved. Roads handle 93% of cargo and passenger traffic.

-   Railway: Network covers 2,778 km.

-   Air transport: 181 aerodromes (16 paved, 165 unpaved).

-   Pipeline: 1,224 km long.

-   Ports: Two major ports – Mombasa seaport and Kisumu inland port.

### Road Transport

Road transport is the predominant mode of transport in Kenya. Approximately 93% of all cargo and passenger traffic in the country is transported using this mode. According to the Kenya Roads Board, the total road network for the country is estimated to be 160,886 km, of which, 35% is classified. The, roads are classified into six categories (Classes A to E) and Special Purpose Roads

Table 2.3: Kenya Road Classification

| Road Category                 | Paved (km)      | Unpaved (km)      | Total (km)  |
|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| A (International Trunk Roads) | 2,772 (77%)     | 816 (23%)         | 3,588       |
| B (National Trunk Roads)      | 1,489 (56%)     | 1,156 (44%)       | 2,645       |
| C (Primary Roads)             | 2,693 (34%)     | 5,164 (66%)       | 7,857       |
| D (Secondary Roads)           | 1,238 (12%)     | 9,483 (88%)       | 10,721      |
| E (Minor Roads)               | 577 (2%)        | 26,071 (98%)      | 26,649      |
| SPR (Special Purpose Roads)   | 100 (1%)        | 10,376 (99%)      | 10,476      |

Kenya’s road network is categorized as follows:

-   Primary Roads (Class C): Connect regionally important centers and higher-class roads.

-   Secondary Roads (Class D): Link local centers to each other or to more important centers.

-   Minor Roads (Class E): Serve access to minor centers.

-   Special Purpose Roads (Class F): Include roads for tourism, agriculture, townships, and strategic purposes.

-   Unclassified Roads (Class U): Comprise all other public roads and streets not covered in other classes.

The road classification framework was introduced in NUTRANS (2006) and formalized in the Kenya Roads Classification Manual (2009).

**International and National Trunk Roads** ***International Trunk Roads (Class A):*** Connect international centers or cross borders/terminate at ports. Kenya has seven such corridors totaling 3,755 km (2,886 km paved; 869 km unpaved). The A104 and A109 are most critical, forming the Northern Corridor from Mombasa port to Nairobi, western towns, and border points like Malaba and Busia.

***National Trunk Roads (Class B):*** Link nationally important centers across 10 major links, totaling 2,645 km (1,489 km paved).

**Current Transport Usage and Challenges** Private vehicles dominate road usage in urban centers like Nairobi, far exceeding the number of public transport vehicles (buses and matatus).

The road transport sector faces major challenges, including:

-   Inadequate funding for development and maintenance

-   Poor and uneven road network distribution

-   Inefficient transport systems and traffic management

-   Absence of dedicated lanes for buses, non-motorized users (e.g., bicycles), and emergency services

|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **International Highway** | Roads forming strategic routes and corridors, connecting international boundaries and international terminals (e.g., ports). *(Class A, Class B)* |
| **Major Arterial Road** | Roads linking district headquarters and other major towns to higher-level networks. They support through-traffic and long-distance movements. *(Class C, Class H)* |
| **Minor Arterial Road** | Provide the main connections between different zones in an urban area. *(Class J)* |
| **Collector Road** | Link arterials and local roads, distributing traffic to residential and other defined zones. *(Class K, Class L)* |
| **Local Road** | Provide direct access to residences, social/economic activities, and government institutions. *(Class M, Class N, Class P)* |

### Rail Transport

Railway transport is the second most important mode of transportation in Kenya after roads, serving both freight and passenger needs. The national rail network covers approximately 2,778 kilometers, comprising mainlines, branch lines, and private sidings. Designed for speeds of up to 60 km/h for freight and 80 km/h for passenger trains, the system has the potential to handle up to 7 million tons of cargo annually. Rail operations are primarily managed by Rift Valley Railways (RVR) and Magadi Railways (MR), the latter operating a 146 km line between Konza and Magadi on behalf of the Magadi Soda Company. These services function under concession agreements with the Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC).

### Maritime and Inland Water Transport

Kenya’s primary maritime gateway is the Port of Mombasa, which is complemented by smaller coastal ports such as Lamu, Malindi, and Shimoni. Mombasa Port plays a vital role in both national and regional trade, serving not only Kenya but also several landlocked countries in the region—including Uganda, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and South Sudan—collectively accounting for 27% of the port’s total cargo throughput. The port is equipped with 19 deep-water berths, including dedicated terminals for container handling. In 2015, Mombasa Port handled approximately 1.08 million Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units (TEUs), up from 1.01 million TEUs in 2014, and recorded a total cargo throughput of 26.7 million tons—representing a 7.5% increase compared to the previous year.

### Pipeline Transport

Kenya’s petroleum pipeline system was established to ease pressure on the Northern Corridor by reducing road deterioration caused by heavy fuel transport. While the volume of petroleum products transported through the pipeline has been steadily increasing, the system still faces significant competition from road and rail modes. Nonetheless, it remains a critical component in the country’s fuel distribution infrastructure, ensuring efficient delivery of petroleum products nationwide.

### Air Transport

Kenya has a well-developed aviation sector with over 200 airports and airfields across the country. These include five international airports—Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (Nairobi), Mombasa, Eldoret, Kisumu, and Wajir—alongside 35 airstrips and 160 smaller airfields. Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) is the largest and busiest airport in East Africa, serving as a major regional hub. It hosts over 40 passenger airlines and 25 cargo carriers, positioning Kenya as a key gateway to the region. The national carrier, Kenya Airways, operates from JKIA and connects to more than 58 global destinations. To accommodate growing air traffic and enhance service delivery, the airport is undergoing major expansion works.

### Non-Motorized and Intermediate Means of Transport (NMIMT)

Non-Motorized and Intermediate Means of Transport (NMIMT), such as walking and cycling, play a vital role in urban mobility, particularly for low-income residents who often find public transport unaffordable. In Nairobi, it is estimated that 39% of residents walk to work. However, poor modal integration and the lack of adequate infrastructure—such as dedicated pedestrian walkways and cycling lanes—have made NMIMT not just a choice, but a necessity for many urban dwellers.

## Physical Infrastructure and Utilities

**Electricity**

Electricity is a cornerstone of Kenya’s development, supporting education, health, agriculture, and economic growth. Kenya relies heavily on hydroelectric power, with key stations like Kindaruma and Turkwel Gorge contributing to a total capacity of over 500 MW. The rural electrification program has expanded access significantly, connecting thousands of trading centers, schools, and health facilities. However, national connectivity remains low, with 28% access overall—54% in urban areas and only 22% in rural regions. The NSP advocates increased use of renewable energy—geothermal, wind, solar, and biomass—to reach full access by 2030.

**Water**

Supply Kenya is a water-scarce country, with per capita renewable freshwater availability (647 m³) far below global standards and neighboring countries. Rural access to clean water remains limited; many rely on springs and seasonal rainwater harvesting, which is often rudimentary. The government aims to boost water availability through major investments in dams and rainwater harvesting systems, including construction of multi-purpose dams in ASAL areas. Major challenges include pollution, deforestation, and inadequate infrastructure, especially in growing urban areas.

**Sanitation and Waste Management**

Only 7.2% of the urban population is connected to sewer systems, and many treatment facilities operate below capacity. Most urban areas lack sustainable sanitation systems and rely on pit latrines or septic tanks. About 64% of Kenyans use traditional latrines, 17% access improved sanitation, and 18% still practice open defecation. Solid waste management is especially problematic in major cities like Nairobi and Mombasa, where inadequate and poorly located disposal sites lead to environmental hazards. The NSP calls for sustainable waste management systems to improve urban livability.

**Information and Communication Technology (ICT)**

The ICT sector has grown significantly, aided by liberalization and infrastructure development like the National Optic Fibre Backbone Infrastructure (NOFBI). Kenya now has over 20,000 km of fiber optic cables. Despite this progress, internet and telephony costs remain high. Vision 2030 identifies ICT as a key pillar for national competitiveness, with projects like Konza Techno City expected to advance business process outsourcing and digital integration.

## Social Infrastructure

**Education**

Kenya has a growing number of educational institutions, including 22 public universities, 9 constituent colleges, and hundreds of tertiary institutions. Although enrollment is improving, transition rates—especially from primary to secondary—remain low, partly due to limited Early Childhood Development (ECD) centers in rural areas.

**Health**

Health services are unevenly distributed, with high-quality care concentrated in urban centers. National referral hospitals like Kenyatta National Hospital and Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital offer the highest levels of care. Below these are provincial and sub-district hospitals, health centers, and dispensaries. Rural areas face persistent challenges including drug shortages, under-staffing, and poor access to medical facilities.

**Sports, Culture, and Arts**

Sports infrastructure is vital both socially and economically. Kenya’s international stadia—Moi International Sports Centre and Nyayo Stadium—support national athletics. Ongoing projects include international sports academies and regional stadia. Cultural heritage is preserved through the National Museums of Kenya, which operates museums and cultural sites across the country. The Kenya Cultural Centre promotes performing arts, while national and public libraries enhance access to information and literacy, particularly for the rural poor.

## Land Use Patterns in Kenya

Kenya's land use patterns are shaped by a combination of ecological, socio-cultural, policy-driven, technological, and demographic factors. Variation in physical characteristics such as climate, rainfall, temperature, slope, and soil, combined with unequal adoption of technology, have led to uneven spatial distribution of land uses across the country.

Historically, land use has evolved in response to government policies, infrastructure development, and economic viability, as well as population growth and rapid urbanization. A notable trend has been the conversion of prime agricultural land into residential and industrial uses, driven by expanding urban areas.

The major drivers of land use change include:

-   Increasing population and land fragmentation

-   Rising demand for food and cash crops

-   Overgrazing and degradation of rangelands

-   Deforestation, especially in tropical forests

-   Rapid urbanization and the expansion of the urban ecological footprint

At present, Kenya's land uses can broadly be classified into the following categories:

-   Agriculture

-   Pastoralism

-   Conservation

-   Industrial activities

-   Transport and infrastructure

-   Urban development

These trends highlight the urgent need for integrated and sustainable land use planning to ensure optimal utilization of Kenya’s land resources, while balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability.

**1. Agricultural Land**

Agriculture is a cornerstone of Kenya's economy, contributing 24% to GDP and 60% to export earnings, with 90% of the population relying on land for their livelihoods. Agricultural land is classified into seven agro-climatic zones based on rainfall, temperature, and evaporation ratios. These zones determine the land’s suitability for various uses, including crop production, livestock farming, and conservation.

The bulk of Kenya’s land—about 65%—falls within marginal zones (VI–VII), where extensive pastoralism is common. The greatest threats to agricultural land include:

-   Population pressure, causing fragmentation

-   Urban expansion converting farmland into residential or industrial zones

-   Degradation of productive land due to overuse and underutilization

2.  **Urban Land**

    Urban areas are hubs for innovation, education, industrialization, and cultural growth, currently generating over 65% of Kenya’s GDP. As of 2009, 32.3% of the population lived in urban areas; this figure is projected to reach 54% by 2030. However, urban growth has been largely unplanned, leading to:

-   Proliferation of informal settlements

-   Inadequate infrastructure and basic services

-   Land fragmentation and urban sprawl

-   A shift from horizontal to vertical development to manage space constraints

Urban land use is further influenced by accessibility and land rent, concentrating development along major transport corridors.

3.  **Environmental Conservation Areas**

***Forests Forest cover*** stands at 5.9% of Kenya's land area. Forests provide income, regulate water flow, and maintain biodiversity. However, encroachment, settlement, deforestation, and climate change have degraded these ecosystems, impacting water catchments and increasing erosion.

***Wetlands Wetlands*** occupy 3–4% of land and serve critical roles in flood control, water filtration, biodiversity, and agriculture. Despite their value, wetlands face threats from pollution and conversion into farmland.

***Water Bodies Surface waters*** (e.g., lakes, rivers, oceans) cover 2.2% of Kenya’s land. The Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the Indian Ocean spans 142,400 km² and contains diverse ecosystems. However, sedimentation, pollution, over-extraction, and poor management threaten both inland and coastal water resources.

R***angelands*** 80% of Kenya's landmass consists of rangelands, primarily in ASAL (Arid and Semi-Arid Lands). These areas support pastoralism and wildlife conservation, hosting over 90% of Kenya’s wild game.

Key challenges include:

-   Land degradation from overgrazing

-   Climate change impacts

-   Land tenure insecurity

-   Encroachment and land use conflicts due to emerging uses like commercial farming and urbanization

## Human Settlement Patterns in Kenya

### 1. Settlement Types and Patterns

Human settlements in Kenya are broadly classified into:

-   Urban settlements, which are nodal, densely populated, and characterized by secondary and tertiary activities such as trade, industry, and administration.

-   Rural settlements, which are sparsely populated and primarily engaged in agriculture, fishing, mining, and forestry.

Settlement patterns in Kenya include:

-   Nucleated settlements: Arise from rural-urban and inter-urban migration (e.g., towns and cities).

-   Dispersed/Clustered settlements: Found in rural areas, often due to nomadic lifestyles or cultural practices (e.g., Maasai manyattas).

-   Linear settlements: Develop along transport routes, rivers, and coastlines.

These patterns are influenced by climate, topography, transport infrastructure, and access to resources.

### 2. Urban Settlements

Urban areas are considered engines of development, generating over 65% of Kenya’s GDP. Nairobi alone contributes 50% of this. Kenya’s urban population has been growing rapidly—from 5.3% in 1948 to over 31.3% in 2009, with projections estimating 54% urbanization by 2030.

Urbanization has historically been concentrated along the Northern Corridor (Mombasa–Malaba) and within high potential agricultural zones, leading to regional imbalance in urban development.

Efforts to contain urbanization included the 1970/74 Growth Center Policy, which aimed to develop small and medium towns as alternatives to Nairobi and Mombasa. However, due to poor criteria, lack of resources, and weak planning, the policy fell short.

Current urban challenges include:

-   Uncontrolled urban sprawl

-   Proliferation of informal settlements

-   Inadequate infrastructure and services

-   Environmental degradation

-   Poor transportation systems and governance issues

The National Spatial Plan (NSP) aims to provide policy direction for the sustainable and equitable growth of towns, enhance livability, and improve urban infrastructure and service delivery.

### 3. Rural Settlements

Rural settlements are found throughout Kenya and can be:

-   Clustered: Common in ASALs, where communities live in close-knit villages.

-   Dispersed: Found in high agricultural potential zones like the central highlands and Lake Victoria Basin, often characterized by individual farmsteads.

Rural development focuses on improving quality of life through agriculture, small industries, tourism, infrastructure, and community services.

Challenges facing rural settlements include:

-   Inadequate research and technology for low-potential areas

-   Effects of climate change, especially unreliable rainfall

-   Dependence on rain-fed agriculture

-   Limited access to extension services and markets

-   Urban encroachment and land fragmentation

There is a growing need to plan and modernize rural settlements based on their potential, promote irrigation in ASALs, and support resilient agriculture through better research and infrastructure.
